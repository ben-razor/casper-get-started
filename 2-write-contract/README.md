# Counter Contract On Casper

Step 2 of [Get started with Casper](https://gitcoin.co/issue/casper-network/gitcoin-hackathon/29/100026611) from the Casper Hackathon.

> Complete one of the existing tutorials for writing smart contracts

We document following the tutorial for creating a [Counter Contract](https://docs.casperlabs.io/en/latest/dapp-dev-guide/tutorials/counter).

### 1. Introduction

For local development we will use a faucet account to deploy contracts.

> This command supplies two key pieces of information: the accountâ€™s secret key location and the account hash, which are used to sign deploys and query the network state, respectively.

**casper-client** interacts with the network. a *State Root Hash* shows the current state of the network and helps us check if updates have been made. **casper-client query-state** allows the state of network to be viewed at any time. **casper-client put-deploy** deploys wasm contracts to the network. **casper-client get-deploy** gets the details for a deployed contract.

### 2. Casper Network Client Setup

First we follow a separate tutorial to install a local Casper Node and the [network control tool](https://docs.casperlabs.io/en/latest/dapp-dev-guide/setup-nctl.html). This installs a Python virtual environment and some required Python modules along with some system libraries.

From within the venv, we download and install the Casper node tools:

```
git clone https://github.com/casper-network/casper-node-launcher
git clone https://github.com/casper-network/casper-node
source casper-node/utils/nctl/activate
nctl-compile
```

### 3. Start Local Network

```bash
nctl-assets-setup && nctl-start
```
